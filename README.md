# ScratchTeams
A chrome extension that allows for multiple users to edit the same project file. This is an alternative to using Scratch's built in remixing tool, which adds up to a nice long list of remix attributions. For use of this extension, it requires that you know the emails of your team, therefore it is not recommended that it is used with anyone but known friends.

## How It Works
This extension saves projects in the user's Google Drive, an alternative to saving on Scratch's servers. This allows for Projects to be shared between users, and loaded into the Scratch editor via the extension.

This project is not developed by or affiliated with the Scratch Team.
